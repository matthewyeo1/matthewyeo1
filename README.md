ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @matthewyeo1
  
I am a year 2 Computer Engineering major pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Engineering in NUS

I find joy in delving into both the software and hardware aspects of my field of study, such as mobile/web app development, IoT, AI, machine learning, computer & network architecture, embedded computing as well as FPGA programming

With my knowledge and skills pertaining to the above areas, I actively engage in academic, individual projects and hackathons to not only apply what I have learnt but to also keep an open mind to new concepts
